        <p>Hello, and welcome to my website. This website has so far only been built with HTML and CSS but hopefully later on I'll develop more web development languages.  I'm currently residing in New York City and I am attending School of the Future High School. Most of my time is spent at home on Roosevelt Island (The island shown in those three pictures!) gaming or doing extracurricular programs in the city such as the All Star Code Summer Intensive or doing Kung Fu classes.</p>
